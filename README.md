# tec-P-NP

What would happen if someone proves P=NP or P!=NP?
- every NP problem would contain a hidden shortcut, allowing computers to quickly find perfect solutions to them.
- would include renewed interest in finding a reduction algorithm. 
- try to find some lower bounds on the constants associated with the reduction algorithm.
- it would break all forms of cryptographic security such as AES, DES etc and would be able to spy on virtually any government.
- be able to speed up complex scientific modelling by a large factor which would result if hazardous mutations of science if not controlled and regulated. Protein synthesis among other things works on an exponential algorithm, and so do sub atomic modelling.
- a step closer to developing self aware AI, which could be used for lots of complex cyber crimes over the internet.
 

### polynomial time algorithms

is an algorithm whose execution time is either given by a polynomial on the size of the input, or can be bounded by such a polynomial. Problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm are called tractable problems. For example, most algorithms on arrays can use the array size, n, as the input size. To find the largest element in an array requires a single pass through the array, so the algorithm for doing this is O(n), or linear time. Sorting algorithms usually require either O(n log n) or O(n2) time. Bubble sort takes linear time in the best case, but O(n2) time in the average and worst cases. Heapsort takes O(n log n) time in all cases. Quicksort takes O(n log n) time on average, but O(n2) time in the worst case. Regarding O(n log n) time, note that; the base of the logarithms is irrelevant, since the difference is a constant factor, which we ignore; and although n log n is not, strictly speaking, a polynomial, the size of n log n is bounded by n2, which is a polynomial. Probably all the programming tasks you are familiar with have polynomial-time solutions. This is not because all practical problems have polynomial-time solutions. Rather, it is because your courses and your day-to-day work have avoided problems for which there is no known practical solution .https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit596/notes/dave/p-and-np0.html


### Solution steps
1. Determine if the problem is in NP.
2. If the problem is in NP, then use polynomial time algorithms to solve the problem.
3. If the problem is not in NP, then it is probably not a P-problem.
